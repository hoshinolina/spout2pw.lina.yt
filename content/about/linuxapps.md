Sure! Spout2PW uses [libfunnel](https://github.com/hoshinolina/libfunnel/) under the hood, which is a library developed to make creating PipeWire video streams easy, just like Spout2 on Windows (or even easier). If you are an application developer and you want to add PipeWire video support to a native Linux build of your app, please check out the [repo](https://github.com/hoshinolina/libfunnel/) and the [docs](https://libfunnel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!
