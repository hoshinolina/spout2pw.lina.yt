# Spout2PW: Spout2 on Linux bridge

Streaming on Linux, but tired of green screens and window capture? Spout2PW makes your favorite [Spout-compatible](https://spout.zeal.co/) Windows apps work on Linux, streaming clean video directly into OBS.

No backgrounds, no title bars, no UI, no transparency issues.

Works with VTube Studio, VRChat, VSeeFace, and [more](https://github.com/hoshinolina/spout2pw/wiki#app-specific-tips)!
